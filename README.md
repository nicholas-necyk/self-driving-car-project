# **Self-Driving Car Project**

This is my capstone project for the Data Science Bootcamp Program at BrainStation. The project consists of programing a simulator car to learn from data previously generated by users on training mode. The data is fitted to a convolutional neural network regression model using Keras and with that the car can infer how to drive by itself.

For a more in-depth explanation of this project, please check the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb)

## **Project Files**

- **track1/**
    - Folder that contains the data (images and a .csv file) generated in training mode from the lake track

- **track2/**
    - Folder that contains the data (images and a .csv file) generated in training mode from the mountain track

- **drive.py**
    - Python script that interfaces with the simulator. What the code does essentially is: receives the screen-captured images from the simulator, runs them thru the pre-trained convolutional neural network (calculating the steering angle) and sends the result to the simulator

- **model.h5**
    - The pre-trained model of track1 (lake track)

- **model-track2.h5**
    - The pre-trained model of track2 (mountain track)

- **track1.ipynb**
    - Jupyter Notebook code used to work with the data of track1 (lake track) and was the code that produced model.h5

- **track2.ipynb**
    - Jupyter Notebook code used to work with the data of track2 (mountain track) and was the code that produced model-track2.h5
